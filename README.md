Monte Carlo Simulations
=======================

This is a repository with a few trial Monte-Carlo simulations.
I wanted to learn about these kinds of simulations, so I gave it a shot!

- integration/
  Uses Monte-Carlo simulations to compute the integral of a function

- pi-estimation/
  Uses Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the value of pi
